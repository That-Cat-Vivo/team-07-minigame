**Define the desired gameplay. What are you making?**
    

We are making a 2 player air  hockey game with various power ups.

**Outline an objective statement for the design. What emotional and gameplay goals are you striving for with this design? Why?**
    

Our objective statement: How can adding additional elements to an existing 2 player game change the gameplay dynamics of said game?

Our focus is on competition between the players and the motivating factor in our game involves skill-based gameplay. These aspects will make mastering the game more satisfying and enjoyable.

**Detail design rationale. What do you envision? How does this support the overall project/company goal?**
    

We envision having a fast-paced  game where both players scramble to get the power ups with their paddles to get the advantage over their opponent while simultaneously having to play a normal game of air hockey against the opponent.

**Cite all resources, tangible, informative, and transformative. Cite all resources used in planning and development including the basis project, assets, guides, tutorials, and use of generative AI.**
